For our Data Analytics final project, we decided to work on the data set that contains natality data based on CDC-collected statistics for live births occurring within the United States to U.S. residents. This information contains the year the certain individual was born, the county of residence, the zip code of the county of residence, the amount of births that happened in the specific county, the average age of the mother, etc,.The questions that will be addressed are the number of births and the average age of women giving birth per year. The data will measure the birth trends by country, find trends in ages, and trends in residency.
